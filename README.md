# Picture_Classifier-using-TensorFlow 
Using a neural Network model to classify pictures.
# Concise Steps:
1.  We will be taking our datasets from MNIST( whichhas a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples) and also digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
2. Then firstly we encode the labels, after that a neural network model is created using tensorflow and is trained in such a manner that it fits the dataset
 3. Visualization the predictions made to the model and finally an accuracy of 92% is achieved in classifying the pictures(in this case digits).
